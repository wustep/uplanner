# UPlanner

Personalized event digest platform for universities and colleges

## Description

UPlanner is an events platform that:

1. Scrapes multiple different platforms (Google Calendar, TeamUp, others) creating a comprehensive database of every public event on campus from lectures to concerts to sporting events
2. Runs an API webserver allowing queries into the database, pulling events, tags, user preferences, etc.
3. Runs a webserver that presents this information to the client and allows the user to provide preferences that personalize the events
